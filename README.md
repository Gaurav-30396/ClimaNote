# ClimaNote
ClimaNote is a minimalist Android weather app built with Jetpack Compose and MVVM architecture. It fetches real-time weather data and interprets it into a single clear summary and a practical action, helping users understand the day at a glance. Uses Retrofit, Coroutines, StateFlow, and DataStore for clean, lifecycle-aware state management.
